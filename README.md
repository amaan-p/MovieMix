# 🎬 MOVIEMIX

Born from movie nights and laptop struggles - a simple solution to find where to watch your favorite films. Because sometimes, you just need to escape into a good movie without the endless search.

## ✨ Why This Exists

Ever felt overwhelmed trying to find where to watch something? Same here. I built this because:
- I was tired of jumping between different streaming sites
- Movies are my escape when things get tough
- Wanted something simple that just works on laptops
- I didn't want to deal with signing up or entering personal information just to watch a movie
- Thought others might find it useful too

## 🎯 Features

- 🔍 Easy movie search across platforms
- 🎲 Random movie picker when you can't decide
- 📊 Detailed movie info and ratings
- 📺 Streaming availability
- 🔄 Daily updated trending movies

## ⚠️ About Ads

This app uses the VidSrc API, which means:
- Yes, there are some ads
- No, I don't make money from them
- They're from the API, not my choice
- Feel free to use an ad blocker
